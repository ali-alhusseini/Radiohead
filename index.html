        <p>
        Radiohead is an English band, five figures bound together since the quiet corridors of an Oxfordshire school, who over decades have turned the chaos of modern life into sound.
        Their music is at once intimate and immense, fragile and unyielding â€” a mirror held up to the alienation, dread, and fleeting beauty of the age.
        From the disquieting anthems of OK Computer to the spectral landscapes of Kid A and the melancholic clarity of A Moon Shaped Pool,
        they have dismantled the very idea of what a rock band should be, and rebuilt it into something haunting, restless, and strangely human.
